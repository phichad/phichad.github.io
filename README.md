## 👋 Hi, I'm Philix!

- 👀 I’m interested in visual arts and am working on expanding my knowledge of design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UX/UI Design along with some basic front-end development.
- 💞️ I enjoy drawing, painting, wood-carving, photography, filmmaking, editing in Photoshop, and prototyping in Figma.
- 📫 If you're interested in collaborating on a project, feel free to email me at philixchadbourn@gmail.com.
-✨ I'll also include some examples of my work and links to my socials below if you'd like to check them out.
